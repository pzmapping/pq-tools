Installation Guide

These tools are made for Build 42.

🔧 Installation (Build 42)

1. Put LuaTools.txt into your Tiled folder.  
2. Delete everything inside Tiled/lua first to avoid conflicts.  
3. Copy the files from the Folder **Original Lua** into `Tiled/lua`.  
4. Then copy all the **pq-tools** Lua files from the Folder **Lua** into the same folder.

Since i changed a lot over the last versions, starting fresh this way prevents conflicts. The pq-tools Lua files are fully independent now. If you copy over pq-tools, no files should need to be replaced, so you wont get any “Do you want to replace these files?” prompts.

Built with ❤️ and zero fluff,
