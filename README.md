# pq-tools

**pq-tools** is a set of tools for **Tiled**, made to help making maps for *Project Zomboid* (Build 42).  
Originally created for personal use, these tools simplify tile placement â€” like scattering cracks, random blood, or placing the new B42 boulders.

Developed by **Pabbiqo**, part of the **Unofficial PZ Mapping Discord**.

**Version:** August 2025 â€“ v3
