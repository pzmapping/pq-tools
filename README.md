pq-tools is a set of Tiled tools designed to speed up map-making for the Mapping Tools (Build 42). Originally a personal project, it simplifies tile placement for cracks, random blood, and the new B42 boulders.

## üîß Installation (Build 42)

1. Put LuaTools.txt into your Tiled folder.  
2. Delete everything inside Tiled/lua first to avoid conflicts.  
3. Copy the files from the ZIP; B42.Mapping.Tools.zip\TileD\lua into your `Tiled/lua`.  
   You can find them here again: https://github.com/Unjammer/WorldEd/releases  
4. Then copy all the **pq-tools** Lua files from the folder **lua** into `Tiled/lua`.

Since I changed a lot over the last versions, starting fresh this way prevents conflicts. The pq-tools Lua files are almost independent now.

If you copy over pq-tools, only the files **parking-stall** and **tool-four-directions** should pop up  
‚ÄúDo you want to replace these files?‚Äù

**Variants and rotations? Covered.**

Many tools come with variants and support different orientations.

Hold **Alt**, **Ctrl**, or **Shift** to rotate objects where supported.  
Some also cycle through models when you click, hold the mouse button, and drag‚Äîlike short lamp posts.

Random tools don‚Äôt rotate (those with a dice icon‚Äîthe randomness stays random).
