pq-tools is a set of tools for Tiled, built to support map-making for Project Zomboid (Build 42).
Originally made for personal use, these tools simplify tile placement â€” like scattering cracks, random blood, or placing the new B42 boulders.

This project is developed by Pabbiqo from Unofficial PZ Mapping Discord.

Version 07/2025 - v2

Installation (Build 42)
Copy LuaTools.txt into your TileZed/ folder.

Copy the contents of the lua/ folder into TileZed/lua/.

Done. Youâ€™ll find new options in Tiledâ€™s tile tool menu.
